      Somewhere around the middle of 2022, I decided to switch from 3D design to programming, 
      for the first few months I started by learning Python - my first OOP language. 
      Throughout that time I learned from online content and built some small Windows applications. 
      Although I liked the language I got interested in how the web works and got into full-stack web dev. From there I started learning the basics of CSS, HTML, Javascript, Java and SQL and built small projects.      `,

      Here, with the team, we created a web application that won first place. 
      I gained valuable experience working in a team, participating in meetings, and helping other colleagues. 
      I also got to participate in workshops about DevOps and testing. 
      One of my favorite parts of the project I was responsible for was a real-time notification system that used a WebSocket connection. 
      The main technologies we used were React, TypeScript, Java with Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Jira (Agile), and Git.

      Here we mainly used ASP.NET, Angular and Azure DevOps.
