      Somewhere around the middle of 2022 I decided to switch from 3D design to programming, 
      for the first few months I started by learning python - my first OOP language. 
      Throught that time I learned from online content and built some small windows applications. 
      Although I liked the language I got interested in how the web works and got into full-stack web dev. 
      From there I started learning the basics of Css, Html, Javascript, Java and Sql and built small projects.

      Here, with the team, we created a web application that won first place. 
      I gained valuable experience working in a team, participating in meetings, and helping other colleagues.

      One of my favorite parts of the project I was responsible for was a real-time notification system that used a WebSocket connection. 
      The main technologies we used were React, TypeScript, Java with Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Jira (Agile), and Git.
