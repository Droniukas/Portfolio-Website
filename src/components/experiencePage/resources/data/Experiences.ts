        Intus Windows is one of the main window manufacturers in the USA that has an office/factory in Lithuania. 
        Here I worked on a large range of different projects, had to work with many different teams and departments of the company, met lots of people, and learned a lot about other systems. 
        I'm very thankful for my manager who put me on different projects, not only letting me work with different teams but also letting me develop an application where I was the only developer from start to finish. 
        The general technologies I worked with were mainly React, Angular, and .Net/C#. Overall the company had a great culture, and people were great fun to work with.`,
